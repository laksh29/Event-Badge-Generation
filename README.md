# Event Badge Generation

This is a WebApp built in Flutter to let attendees download an event badge they are attending. 
The main motive is to promote the event and let attendees showcase that they will attend a particular event.


The badge consists of a basic event design where attendees can add their profile photo and name which can be downloaded as a PNG and used to post on social media.
